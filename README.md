# MERF Viewers
A version of the <a href="https://creiser.github.io/merf/#demos">MERF demo</a> updated to use the latest version of <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> and another version ready for use in React and styled with <a href="https://mui.com/">mui</a>.

react-MERF.js is the version ready for use in React and is independent of the other code in this repository.
